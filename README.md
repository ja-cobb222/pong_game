# Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Pong game, designed as an exercise to enhance software engineering skills and gain experience with Python game development using the Arcade library. The game allows two players to compete in a fast-paced back-and-forth match while keeping score.

Players control paddles on either side of the screen to prevent the ball from going out of bounds. Points are scored when a player misses the ball. The game includes three difficulty levels with different ball speeds and ends when one player reaches 10 points. A winner is then declared.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using the following tools and technologies:
- **Development Environment**: Python 3.11
- **Game Library**: [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/)

# Useful Websites

These resources were invaluable during the development of this project:
* [Python Arcade Documentation](https://api.arcade.academy/)
* [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

# Future Work

Here are some ideas for future improvements and enhancements:
* Add AI to allow a single player to play against the computer.
* Improve collision physics for more realistic ball movement.
* Introduce power-ups or special features, such as paddle shrink/growth.
* Add sound effects and background music for a more engaging experience.
